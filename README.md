# TypeID Ruby

A Ruby implementation of [TypeIDs](https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid)

TypeIDs are a modern, **type-safe**, globally unique identifier based on the upcoming
UUIDv7 standard. They provide a ton of nice properties that make them a great choice
as the primary identifiers for your data in a database, APIs, and distributed systems.
Read more about TypeIDs in their [spec](https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid).
